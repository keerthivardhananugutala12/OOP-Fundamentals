On 22 April 2025, a terrorist attack at Baisaran Valley near Pahalgam in the Anantnag district of Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir killed at least 26 tourists and injured more than 20 others. The attack, the deadliest of its kind in India since the 2008 Mumbai attacks, specifically targeted male Hindu tourists, and was reportedly aimed at resisting demographic changes in the Kashmir Valley. The Resistance Front, an offshoot of the Pakistan-based, UN-designated terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the attack.
